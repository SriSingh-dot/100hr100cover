    <img src="pas12re.jpg" alt="Dogs Playing Poker">
    <h2>"Dogs Playing Poker" by Cassius Marcellus Coolidge (1903–1910)</h2>
    <p>In Dogs Playing Poker, a group of very serious dogs sit around a table, smoking cigars and betting biscuits like furry mob bosses. One bulldog is clearly bluffing, but his tail's wagging like a metronome on espresso. The collie's all in, probably because he misunderstood and thought they were literally playing bones. Meanwhile, a chihuahua needs a booster seat and moral support. This is not art - It's chaos in fur coats. You just know someone's going to bark at the dealer. Honestly, it's the most intense poker night ever.... and no one remembered to bring the fire hydrant.</p>

  <div class="painting">
  <img src="pas13.jpg" alt="The Garden of Earthly Delights">
  <h2>"The Garden of Earthly Delights" by Hieronymus Bosch (c. 1490–1510)</h2>
  <p>The Garden of Enathly Delights is like a medieval fever dream where someone spiked the paint water. Imagine a Renaissance picnic gone wild: giant strawberries bigger than your head, people riding giant birds like scooters, and fish casually moonlighting as furniture. Its's as if Hieronymus Bosch asked, "What if Instagram filters were real life?" and then painted every random thought at once. The left panel is Eden, the right is Hell and  middle is one giant "what happens in the garden stays in garden" party. Basically, it's a 500-year old warning that humans plus snacks equal delightful chaos.</p>

<!--Third painting--><!--photo done-->
<div class="painting">
  <img src="pas14.jpg" alt="The Nightmare">
  <h2>"The Nightmare" by Henry Fuseli (1781)</h2>
  <p>The painting "The Nightmare" shows a women knocked out on a couch while a tiny demon casually sits on her chest, like it ows the plalce. Behind them, a ghostly horse peeks throwugh the curtains with glowing eyes,as if wondering what's going on. The scene feels like the result of a late-night snack gone wrong- half spooky, half absurd. It's creepy, but also oddly funny, like a Halloween party that forgot to end. The painting captures that feeling when your dreams mix horror and comedy, leaving you to wake up thinking, "Well, that was weird." /p>
</div>


<!--Fourth painting--><!--photo done-->
<div class="painting">
  <img src="pas15.jpg" alt="The Jolly Toper">
  <h2>"The Jolly Toper" by Judith Leyster (c. 1629)</h2>
  <p>The painting "The Jolly Toper" is basically a 17th-century painting of a guy mid-toast, already three mugs ahead of everyone else. His cheeks are rosier than a sunset, his grin says, "Refill, please " and his tilted hat is holding on for  dear life. You can almost hear the slurred "Cheers!" as he raises his glass, determined to break some kind of world record for merriment. This isn't quiet evening drink- this is a full blown "I'm the party" moment. If happiness were a person, it'd look exactly like this slightly wobbly fellow, forever immortalized in oil and probably a bit of ale.</p>
</div>


<!--Fifth painting--><!--photo done-->
<div class="painting">
  <img src="pas16.jpg" alt="Self-Portrait with Monkey">
  <h2>"Self-Portrait with Monkey" by Frida Kahlo (1938)</h2>
  <p>This painting by Frida Kahlo is basically the ultimate 'me and my clingy friend' snapshot. Frida Kahlo  stares straight at you with that "I see through your nonsence." look,while the monkey hugs her shoulder like it's audition for Best Supporting Actor. The leafy background screams jungle spa day, but Frida's vibe is pure queen-of-serenity. The monkey? Total drama sidekick! fluffy,wide-eyed, and plotting to steal the spotlight (or maybe her earrings). Together they are the defination of calm chaos: Frida, all poise and brow-power; monkey the mischievous plus one. It's the kind of portrait that says , "Yes! I bring my own audience".</p>
