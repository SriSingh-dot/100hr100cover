        <h1>The Great Emu War</h1>
        <p>In 1932, Australia decided to go to war—not with another country, but with emus. Farmers were tired of emus trampling crops, so the army rolled in with machine guns. The emus were fast, clever, and apparently had a better escape plan than most soldiers. Bullets missed, soldiers got frustrated, and the emus strutted off like they owned the place. After weeks of chaos, the army surrendered. Humans lost, emus won, and history got one of its funniest battle stories ever.</p>
        <p>Birds 1 – Humans 0.</p>

        <h1>Napoleon Was Attacked by Rabbits</h1>
        <p>Napoleon Bonaparte, conqueror of Europe, once faced an enemy he couldn’t defeat: rabbits. He organized a grand hunting party, expecting a noble chase. Instead, the rabbits—raised as tame pets—ran straight toward the humans like a fluffy army. Napoleon, in full regalia, tried to command order while rabbits swarmed him, hopping into coats and hats. The mighty emperor was undone by bunnies, proving the smallest warriors can be the most terrifying.</p>

        <h1>The Dancing Plague of Strasbourg</h1>
        <p>In 1518, Strasbourg hosted the world’s weirdest dance party—whether anyone wanted it or not. Dozens began dancing uncontrollably in the streets for days. Some danced themselves into exhaustion, and a few even died—talk about overdoing cardio. Historians debate the cause: mass hysteria, spicy bread, or mysterious “dancing mania.” Whatever it was, imagine going to market and suddenly being forced to twerk like it’s a medieval TikTok challenge.</p>

        <h1>The Cadaver Synod (897 CE)</h1>
        <p>In 897 CE, Pope Stephen VI staged what might be history’s weirdest trial: the Cadaver Synod. He dug up Pope Formosus’ corpse, dressed it in papal robes, and put it on trial. The dead pope, of course, stayed silent. The court found him guilty, proving medieval bureaucracy could be absurd. Imagine explaining that in law school: “Yes, your honor, the defendant is very dead, but paperwork demands justice.”</p>

        <h1>The Pig War</h1>
        <p>In 1859, the U.S. and Britain nearly went to war over…a pig. On San Juan Island, an American farmer shot a British Hudson’s Bay Company pig caught eating his potatoes. Tempers flared faster than bacon grease pops. Soon, soldiers faced off, cannons waited, and the unlucky hog became the spark of international drama. Cooler heads prevailed; the pig remained the lone casualty—history’s tastiest peace negotiator.</p>

        <h1>The Great Molasses Flood (1919)</h1>
        <p>In 1919 Boston, a massive molasses tank exploded, creating a sticky river of chaos. A 25-foot wave of syrup raced through the streets at nearly 25 mph—fast enough to outrun a horse, slow enough to look hilariously doomed in slow motion. People, carts, and even rats were swept up like toppings in the world’s largest pancake disaster. Firefighters waded knee-deep, probably craving waffles while regretting life choices. Cleanup took weeks, and the city smelled like a rogue candy factory.</p>

        <h1>Dancing Goats Inspired Coffee</h1>
        <p>Legend says coffee was discovered by a goat with killer dance moves. In Ethiopia, herder Kaldi noticed his goats bouncing like caffeinated pogo sticks after munching red berries. Curious, he tried them too—boom! Goat groove unlocked. Soon Kaldi was moonwalking across hillsides, inventing espresso energy centuries early. Monks brewed the beans to stay awake during prayers, accidentally creating the first study fuel. Next time you sip a latte, remember: it began with a hyper goat throwing a caffeine rave.</p>

    <h1>Peter the Great’s Beard Tax</h1>
    <p>Peter the Great of Russia wasn’t just a powerful czar—he was also a fashion police officer. Determined to make his nobles look “modern,” he imposed a beard tax, forcing men to pay coins to keep their facial hair. Refuse, and you were shorn like a sheep. Imagine trying to enjoy your morning coffee while keeping track of how many kopeks you owed for chin fuzz. Barbers must have been ecstatic, and men probably wished they could just hide beards under hats. Peter proved that even in the 18th century, politics could be painfully… hairy.</p>
