# History Akhbaar
When i started writing this the only thing which came to me was that many of us hate History. Is there any way I find History funny.
You must have noticed while scrolling through your insta that you find some thriller and funny historic news interesting.


So inspired- i created this website
The first page which is "Explore.html" is just as a joke
All other files attached are made from Html


Features:
- first page i made is o home page (its simple landing page with buttons)
- explore.html takes you to Egyptian History (so it was actually just a page from history all from my 10th grade history)
- fun.html is where the fun actually begins
- This whole projects consits of:
  1)Funny historic events that occured
  2)About paintings which i exaggerated and wrote in a funny way
  3)I have also made a personality quiz and the result site is attached to it.
  4)At the end i realised that maybe a index page would be good containing all content page.
  5) a lot of external linking.

What I learned:
-i never thought that making a large project would be this difficult.
-to perfect each and every website i had to fix the older one according to them.
- it required a lot of patience for me and i learned a lot of things like i did not know that one could use pull to get all the other attached files from github.
- I learned how to fix mistakes in vs code only instead of deleting.
- I also realised that if i do not know how to make designs in background then a image would be perfect instead of a solid plane color.
